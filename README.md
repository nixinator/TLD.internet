# TLD.internet

**Note:** This kick-starter hasn't been submitted yet. Please read and help solve open bugs.

.internet fights against internet fragmention.

Web4 is a term that is used to refer to the next generation of the internet. It is also known as the “more” decentralized web. Web4 aims to create a more decentralized and distributed internet that is controlled by its users rather than centralized organizations or corporations. web4 will be .internet

# Kickstarter
The kickstart project is to raise the funds to apply for buying the .internet top level domain. An application is $180,000,
plus $5000 as a deposit, plus an unknown amount for application disputes and administrative fees.

We don't have $200,000 lying around, and need your help!

# Kickstarter Rewards

To motivate participation:

## $20

Skip coffee for a week and join the TLD.internet movement!

You get ``internetfounder`` status. Register up to 4 domains in an exclusive 1 month window 
before general .internet domain name availability.
 
Limited to first 10,000 pledges. No, seriously, remember how fast Scion Day sells out ;)

## $500

Can you afford more? Passionate about the web and preventing internet fragmentation?

Same benefits as ``internetfounder`` as well as an invitation to join the governance committee.

Limited to first 50 pledges.

# Why?
Okay, this is kind of a vanity TLD, but we freaking build the distrubuted web every day...  Shouldn't we have a TLD that 
internet hackers control?

Domains will be granted to their obvious owners... vince.internet to vince, mars.internet goes to musk, etc.

Got a federated, distributed, p2p, open protocol project and need a chat.internet or meetup.internet or whatever it's yours.

Centralised services squatters will not be tolerated, to the best of the project's ability to limit or ban this behavior...

# After Kickstarter
Again, the governance committee would figure out how to make the TLD.internet a substainable project that does not need frequent maintenance.

TLD.internet is not a for-profit venture. The Kick Starter is only to raise enough funds to navigate the unknown waters of securing our TLD.

``.internet`` domains will be as inexpensive as possible. We'll figure out a way to reward everyone who helped us 
secure this TLD.

# Who will run this?
[I](http://github.com/nixiator) and the signers below, have offered to volunteer their time to organize this application process. If we successfully get the `.internet` TLD, , we'll create a governance committee to figure how to best steward this beast, supporting distributed/p2p/federated projects 'forever'.
