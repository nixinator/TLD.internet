# TLD.internet

**Note:** This kick-starter hasn't been submitted yet. Please read and help solve open bugs.

.internet fights against internet fragmention and embraces web4.

Web4 is a term that is used to refer to the next generation of the internet. It is also known as the “more” decentralized web. Web4 aims to create a more decentralized and distributed internet that is controlled by its users rather than centralized organizations or corporations. web4 will be .internet

Web4 This covers open 

* networking protocols
* hardware
* software

and many many more people and projects that fight against fragmentation, walled gardens and centralisation.

.internet represents Open, Federdated, Distributed and p2p technology. This is web4.

# Kickstarter
The kickstart project is to raise the funds to apply for buying the .internet top level domain. An application is $180,000,
plus $5000 as a deposit, plus an unknown amount for application disputes and administrative fees.

We don't have $200,000 lying around, and need your help!

# Kickstarter Rewards

To motivate participation:

## $20

Skip coffee for a week and join the TLD.internet movement!

You get ``internetfounder`` status. Register up to 4 domains in an exclusive 1 month window 
before general .internet domain name availability.
 
Limited to first 10,000 pledges. No, seriously, remember how fast Scion Day sells out ;)

## $500

Can you afford more? Passionate about the web and preventing internet fragmentation?

Same benefits as ``internetfounder`` as well as an invitation to join the governance committee.

Limited to first 50 pledges.

# Why?
Okay, this is kind of a vanity TLD, but we freaking build the distrubuted web every day...  Shouldn't we have a TLD that 
internet hackers control?

Domains will be granted to their obvious owners... 

Got a federated, distributed, p2p, open protocol project and need a matrix.chat.internet, xmpp.chat.internet etc etc or it's yours.

However, project needs to be open and be able to fully distributed or federated within the protocol. 

Centralised services squatters will not be tolerated, to the best of the project's ability to limit or ban this behavior...

# After Kickstarter
Again, the governance committee would figure out how to make the TLD.internet a substainable project that does not need frequent maintenance.

TLD.internet is not a for-profit venture. The Kick Starter is only to raise enough funds to navigate the unknown waters of securing our TLD.

``.internet`` domains will be as inexpensive as possible. We'll figure out a way to reward everyone who helped us 
secure this TLD.

# Who will run this?
[I](http://github.com/nixiator) and the signers below, have offered to volunteer their time to organize this application process. If we successfully get the `.internet` TLD, , we'll create a governance committee to figure how to best steward this beast, supporting distributed/p2p/federated projects 'forever'.
